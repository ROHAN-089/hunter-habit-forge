# 🚀 Solo Leveling Habit Builder
Arise From Your Shadow: Transform Daily Habits into Epic Quests and Become the Hunter of Your Destiny. Where Every Day is a New Dungeon to Conquer.

# 📌 Problem Statement
**Problem Statement 12 – Reinvent Personal Development Through Technology**

# 🎯 Objective
Solo Leveling Habit Builder solves the problem of uninspiring habit tracking by transforming personal development into an immersive RPG experience. It serves individuals struggling with consistent habit formation by providing meaningful progression, balanced development frameworks, and community accountability through gamification. The app creates emotional investment in daily habits, leading to lasting behavioral change for users seeking personal growth.

**Approach:**
* I chose this problem because traditional habit trackers fail to maintain long-term user engagement
* Key challenges included balancing game mechanics with effective behavioral psychology
* Initial concept focused on solo play, pivoted to include social features after user research showed accountability was crucial for habit formation

# 🛠️ Tech Stack
**Core Technologies Used:**
* Frontend: React Native, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Lottie

# 🏁 Final Words
Building the Solo Leveling Habit Builder was a race against time! While I couldn't implement every feature in my vision due to technical hurdles and time constraints, launching this MVP is just the beginning. Like Jin-Woo's journey from E-rank to S-rank, this project will continue to level up with each update. The biggest challenge was balancing engaging gameplay with effective habit psychology, but seeing early users already transforming their daily routines into epic quests has made every debugging session worthwhile!
